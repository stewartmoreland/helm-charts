## Target Chart
<!-- Specify which chart this feature request is for, or "new" for a new chart proposal -->
Chart: new - cost-management

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->
Managing and optimizing costs in Kubernetes environments is challenging. Organizations struggle with resource allocation, cost attribution, and optimization across multiple clusters and cloud providers.

## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen -->
A comprehensive cost management chart that includes:
- OpenCost for Kubernetes cost monitoring
- Resource optimization tools
- Cost allocation and chargeback
- Budget management and alerts
- Cloud cost integration
- Resource quotas management
- Cost forecasting
- Optimization recommendations

## Describe alternatives you've considered
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered -->
1. Cloud provider cost tools
2. Manual cost tracking
3. Commercial cost platforms
4. Basic resource monitoring

## Implementation Details
<!-- If you can, explain how this feature might be implemented -->
1. Deploy cost monitoring components
2. Configure cloud provider integration
3. Set up cost allocation rules
4. Implement budget controls
5. Configure optimization rules
6. Set up reporting and dashboards
7. Enable forecasting capabilities
