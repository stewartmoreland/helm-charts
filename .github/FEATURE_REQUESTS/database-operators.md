## Target Chart
<!-- Specify which chart this feature request is for, or "new" for a new chart proposal -->
Chart: new - database-operators

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->
Managing databases in Kubernetes requires specialized knowledge and multiple operators. Organizations need a unified way to manage different types of databases, handle backups, and maintain high availability while following best practices.

## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen -->
A comprehensive database operators chart that includes:
- PostgreSQL Operator (Zalando/CrunchyData)
- MongoDB Community Operator
- Redis Operator
- MySQL Operator
- Elasticsearch Operator
- Backup management integration
- Monitoring integration
- Automatic failover configuration

## Describe alternatives you've considered
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered -->
1. Individual operator installations
2. Cloud provider managed databases
3. Manual database management
4. Commercial database platforms

## Implementation Details
<!-- If you can, explain how this feature might be implemented -->
1. Create unified operator management interface
2. Implement consistent backup strategies
3. Configure monitoring and alerting
4. Set up high availability defaults
5. Implement connection pooling
6. Configure resource management
7. Provide upgrade automation

### Proposed values.yaml changes
<!-- If applicable, suggest how the values.yaml should be modified -->
```yaml
global:
  storageClass: ""
  monitoring:
    enabled: true
  backup:
    enabled: true
    provider: s3
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"

postgresql:
  enabled: true
  operator: zalando
  instances:
    - name: default
      version: "15"
      ha: true
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "1Gi"
          
mongodb:
  enabled: true
  version: "6.0"
  replicaSet:
    enabled: true
    members: 3
    
redis:
  enabled: true
  mode: cluster
  sentinel:
    enabled: true
    
mysql:
  enabled: true
  operator: oracle
  instances:
    - name: default
      version: "8.0"
      replicas: 3
      
elasticsearch:
  enabled: true
  version: "8.x"
  nodes:
    master:
      count: 3
    data:
      count: 3
      
monitoring:
  grafanaDashboards: true
  serviceMonitors: true
  alerts:
    enabled: true
```

### Breaking Changes
<!-- Would this feature introduce breaking changes? Please describe -->
No breaking changes as this is a new chart. Each operator can be enabled independently.

## Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here -->
This chart would provide a unified way to manage various databases in Kubernetes while maintaining best practices for production deployments.

## Benefits
<!-- Describe the benefits this feature would bring to users -->
1. Simplified database operations
2. Consistent management interface
3. Automated backup and recovery
4. High availability by default
5. Integrated monitoring
6. Standardized upgrade procedures
7. Resource optimization
