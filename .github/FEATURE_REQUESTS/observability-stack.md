## Target Chart
<!-- Specify which chart this feature request is for, or "new" for a new chart proposal -->
Chart: new - observability-stack

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->
Setting up a complete observability stack in Kubernetes requires multiple components and careful configuration. Users often need to manually integrate Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and OpenTelemetry, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen -->
A comprehensive observability stack chart that includes:
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Loki for log aggregation
- OpenTelemetry Collector for traces
- Pre-configured dashboards and alerts
- Auto-discovery of Kubernetes resources
- Unified configuration interface

## Describe alternatives you've considered
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered -->
1. Using separate charts for each component
2. Using the Grafana Operator
3. Manual configuration of each component
4. Using commercial observability solutions

## Implementation Details
<!-- If you can, explain how this feature might be implemented -->
1. Create a parent chart with subcharts for each component
2. Implement smart defaults for Kubernetes monitoring
3. Include default dashboards for common use cases
4. Provide unified configuration through values.yaml
5. Implement auto-discovery for common applications
6. Include horizontal pod autoscaling configuration
7. Support for different storage backends

### Proposed values.yaml changes
<!-- If applicable, suggest how the values.yaml should be modified -->
```yaml
global:
  storageClass: ""
  retention: "30d"
  
prometheus:
  enabled: true
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "256Mi"
      cpu: "100m"
    
grafana:
  enabled: true
  dashboards:
    kubernetes: true
    nodes: true
    applications: true
    
loki:
  enabled: true
  persistence:
    size: "10Gi"
    
opentelemetry:
  enabled: true
  samplingRate: 0.1
```

### Breaking Changes
<!-- Would this feature introduce breaking changes? Please describe -->
No breaking changes as this is a new chart. Future versions should maintain backward compatibility with the initial configuration structure.

## Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here -->
This chart would follow the pattern of other enterprise observability stacks but in a cloud-native, open-source format. It would be particularly valuable for teams starting with Kubernetes who need production-grade observability.

## Benefits
<!-- Describe the benefits this feature would bring to users -->
1. Reduced time-to-monitor for new clusters
2. Consistent observability practices across deployments
3. Production-ready defaults with customization options
4. Integrated logging, metrics, and tracing (full observability)
5. Cost-effective alternative to commercial solutions
6. Simplified maintenance and upgrades
7. Built-in best practices for Kubernetes monitoring
