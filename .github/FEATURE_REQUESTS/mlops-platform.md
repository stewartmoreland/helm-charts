## Target Chart
<!-- Specify which chart this feature request is for, or "new" for a new chart proposal -->
Chart: new - mlops-platform

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->
Deploying and managing machine learning workloads on Kubernetes requires extensive setup and integration of multiple tools. Organizations struggle with model serving, experiment tracking, and pipeline orchestration.

## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen -->
A comprehensive MLOps platform chart that includes:
- Kubeflow for ML workflow orchestration
- MLflow for experiment tracking
- Seldon Core for model serving
- Ray for distributed training
- Jupyter Hub for notebook management
- MinIO for model storage
- Model monitoring and drift detection
- GPU operator support

## Describe alternatives you've considered
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered -->
1. Manual Kubeflow installation
2. Cloud provider-specific ML platforms
3. Custom integration of components
4. Commercial MLOps platforms

## Implementation Details
<!-- If you can, explain how this feature might be implemented -->
1. Create a modular chart with optional components
2. Implement auto-scaling for training workloads
3. Include common ML pipeline templates
4. Provide model serving endpoints
5. Setup monitoring and logging
6. Configure resource quotas and GPU scheduling
7. Implement model versioning and tracking

### Proposed values.yaml changes
<!-- If applicable, suggest how the values.yaml should be modified -->
```yaml
global:
  storage:
    class: ""
    size: "100Gi"
  gpu:
    enabled: false
    type: "nvidia.com/gpu"

kubeflow:
  enabled: true
  pipelines:
    enabled: true
    
mlflow:
  enabled: true
  tracking:
    database: postgresql
    
seldon:
  enabled: true
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "2Gi"
      
jupyter:
  enabled: true
  profiles:
    - name: default
      image: jupyter/datascience-notebook
    
ray:
  enabled: true
  workers: 3
  
monitoring:
  enabled: true
  modelDrift: true
  dataQuality: true
```

### Breaking Changes
<!-- Would this feature introduce breaking changes? Please describe -->
No breaking changes as this is a new chart. The modular architecture will allow for component updates without affecting the overall platform.

## Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here -->
This chart would provide a complete MLOps platform that integrates with existing DevOps practices while maintaining scalability and reproducibility for ML workloads.

## Benefits
<!-- Describe the benefits this feature would bring to users -->
1. Rapid deployment of ML infrastructure
2. Standardized ML development environment
3. Scalable model training and serving
4. Experiment tracking and reproducibility
5. Integrated model monitoring
6. Resource optimization for ML workloads
7. Support for both research and production use cases
