## Target Chart
<!-- Specify which chart this feature request is for, or "new" for a new chart proposal -->
Chart: new - multi-cluster-management

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->
Managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across different environments and cloud providers is complex and time-consuming. Organizations struggle with cluster lifecycle management, workload distribution, configuration consistency, and centralized operations across their cluster fleet.

## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen -->
A comprehensive multi-cluster management chart that includes:
- Cluster API for cluster lifecycle management
- Fleet management capabilities
- Multi-cluster service discovery
- Centralized policy management
- Cross-cluster monitoring
- Disaster recovery
- Configuration sync
- Workload scheduling across clusters

## Describe alternatives you've considered
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered -->
1. Manual cluster management
2. Cloud provider-specific solutions
3. Commercial multi-cluster platforms
4. Single cluster with multiple namespaces

## Implementation Details
<!-- If you can, explain how this feature might be implemented -->
1. Deploy cluster management components
2. Set up fleet management
3. Configure cross-cluster networking
4. Implement policy distribution
5. Set up centralized monitoring
6. Configure backup and recovery
7. Enable workload scheduling

### Proposed values.yaml changes

### Breaking Changes
<!-- Would this feature introduce breaking changes? Please describe -->
No breaking changes as this is a new chart. Features can be enabled progressively as the cluster fleet grows.

## Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here -->
This chart would provide a complete multi-cluster management solution that enables organizations to efficiently operate and manage their Kubernetes fleet while maintaining security and compliance.

## Benefits
<!-- Describe the benefits this feature would bring to users -->
1. Simplified cluster lifecycle management
2. Centralized fleet operations
3. Consistent policy enforcement
4. Cross-cluster service discovery
5. Unified monitoring and alerting
6. Automated disaster recovery
7. Efficient workload distribution
