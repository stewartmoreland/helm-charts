## Target Chart
<!-- Specify which chart this feature request is for, or "new" for a new chart proposal -->
Chart: new - edge-computing

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->
Deploying and managing edge computing infrastructure on Kubernetes is complex and requires specialized tools. Organizations struggle with device management, workload distribution, and maintaining consistency across edge locations.

## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen -->
A comprehensive edge computing chart that includes:
- KubeEdge for edge device management
- K3s for lightweight Kubernetes
- MQTT Operator for IoT connectivity
- Edge monitoring stack
- Local storage management
- Sync controller for offline operations
- Edge AI/ML capabilities
- Network mesh for edge communication

## Describe alternatives you've considered
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered -->
1. Manual edge infrastructure setup
2. Cloud provider edge solutions
3. Custom edge management tools
4. Commercial IoT platforms

## Implementation Details
<!-- If you can, explain how this feature might be implemented -->
1. Deploy lightweight Kubernetes distribution
2. Configure edge device management
3. Set up IoT communication protocols
4. Implement offline operation capabilities
5. Configure edge monitoring
6. Set up edge storage solutions
7. Enable edge-to-cloud synchronization
