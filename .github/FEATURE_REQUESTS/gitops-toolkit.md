## Target Chart
<!-- Specify which chart this feature request is for, or "new" for a new chart proposal -->
Chart: new - gitops-toolkit

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->
Implementing GitOps practices requires multiple tools and complex setup. Teams need to integrate CI/CD, secrets management, and policy enforcement while maintaining security and compliance.

## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen -->
A comprehensive GitOps toolkit chart that includes:
- ArgoCD for continuous deployment
- Tekton for CI/CD pipelines
- External Secrets Operator for secrets management
- Kyverno for policy enforcement
- Notification controller for alerts
- Source controller for Git operations
- Pre-configured security policies and best practices

## Describe alternatives you've considered
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered -->
1. Using Flux CD instead of ArgoCD
2. Manual integration of each component
3. Using Jenkins X
4. Commercial GitOps platforms

## Implementation Details
<!-- If you can, explain how this feature might be implemented -->
1. Create a modular chart structure with optional components
2. Implement secure defaults for all components
3. Include common pipeline templates
4. Provide integration with popular Git providers
5. Include default policies for security and compliance
6. Support for multiple environments
7. Built-in backup and disaster recovery

### Proposed values.yaml changes
<!-- If applicable, suggest how the values.yaml should be modified -->
```yaml
global:
  git:
    provider: github
    sshKey: ""
  
argocd:
  enabled: true
  projects:
    - name: default
      autoSync: true
      
tekton:
  enabled: true
  pipelines:
    default: true
    security: true
    
externalSecrets:
  enabled: true
  providers:
    - aws
    - gcp
    - azure
    
kyverno:
  enabled: true
  policies:
    podSecurity: true
    imagePolicy: true
    networkPolicy: true
```

### Breaking Changes
<!-- Would this feature introduce breaking changes? Please describe -->
No breaking changes as this is a new chart. The modular design will allow for component updates without affecting the overall structure.

## Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here -->
This chart would provide a complete GitOps solution that follows the Kubernetes-native approach while maintaining enterprise-grade security and scalability.

## Benefits
<!-- Describe the benefits this feature would bring to users -->
1. Rapid GitOps implementation for new clusters
2. Standardized deployment practices
3. Built-in security and compliance
4. Reduced tool fragmentation
5. Simplified secrets management
6. Automated policy enforcement
7. Streamlined developer experience
