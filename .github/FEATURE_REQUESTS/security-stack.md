## Target Chart
<!-- Specify which chart this feature request is for, or "new" for a new chart proposal -->
Chart: new - security-stack

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->
Implementing comprehensive security in Kubernetes clusters requires multiple tools and complex configurations. Organizations struggle with certificate management, secret handling, security scanning, and policy enforcement across their clusters.

## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen -->
A comprehensive security stack chart that includes:
- Cert-Manager for certificate automation
- Vault Operator for secrets management
- Trivy Operator for vulnerability scanning
- Falco for runtime security
- Open Policy Agent (OPA) for policy enforcement
- OAuth2 Proxy for authentication
- Network Policy operator
- Security audit logging

## Describe alternatives you've considered
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered -->
1. Manual integration of security tools
2. Cloud provider-specific security solutions
3. Commercial security platforms
4. Using service mesh security features only

## Implementation Details
<!-- If you can, explain how this feature might be implemented -->
1. Create modular security components
2. Implement secure defaults for all components
3. Include pre-configured security policies
4. Set up automated certificate management
5. Configure vulnerability scanning pipelines
6. Implement audit logging and monitoring
7. Provide network policy templates

### Proposed values.yaml changes
<!-- If applicable, suggest how the values.yaml should be modified -->
```yaml
global:
  clusterName: ""
  environment: production
  
certManager:
  enabled: true
  clusterIssuers:
    letsencrypt:
      enabled: true
      email: ""
      
vault:
  enabled: true
  ha:
    enabled: false
  audit:
    enabled: true
    
trivy:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "0 */6 * * *"
  severity: "CRITICAL,HIGH"

    custom: []
    
opa:
  enabled: true
  policies:
    podSecurity: true
    networkPolicies: true
    imagePolicy: true

```

### Breaking Changes
<!-- Would this feature introduce breaking changes? Please describe -->
No breaking changes as this is a new chart. The modular design allows for independent component updates.

## Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here -->
This chart would provide enterprise-grade security features in an easy-to-deploy format, following security best practices and compliance requirements for Kubernetes environments.

## Benefits
<!-- Describe the benefits this feature would bring to users -->
1. Comprehensive security coverage out of the box
2. Automated certificate and secrets management
3. Continuous vulnerability scanning
4. Runtime security monitoring
5. Policy-based governance
6. Compliance-ready configurations
7. Simplified security operations
