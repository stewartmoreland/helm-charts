## Target Chart
<!-- Specify which chart this feature request is for, or "new" for a new chart proposal -->
Chart: new - service-mesh

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->
Implementing service mesh in Kubernetes clusters is complex and requires deep understanding of networking, security, and observability. Organizations struggle with setting up reliable service-to-service communication, implementing zero-trust security, and gaining visibility into service interactions.

## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen -->
A comprehensive service mesh chart that includes:
- Istio/Linkerd core installation
- Ingress gateway configuration
- Service-to-service encryption (mTLS)
- Traffic management features
- Observability stack integration
- Circuit breaking and fault injection
- API gateway integration
- Multi-cluster mesh support

## Describe alternatives you've considered
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered -->
1. Manual service mesh installation
2. Using service mesh operator only
3. Cloud provider service mesh solutions
4. Application-level networking

## Implementation Details
<!-- If you can, explain how this feature might be implemented -->
1. Create modular mesh deployment
2. Configure secure communication defaults
3. Set up monitoring and tracing
4. Implement traffic management policies
5. Configure gateway integration
6. Set up multi-cluster support
7. Enable mesh expansion capabilities

### Proposed values.yaml changes
<!-- If applicable, suggest how the values.yaml should be modified -->
```yaml
global:
  meshProvider: istio  # or linkerd
  multiCluster:
    enabled: false
  monitoring:
    enabled: true

mesh:
  enabled: true
  profile: default  # or demo, production
  components:
    pilot: true
    ingressGateways: true
    egressGateways: true
    
security:
  mtls:
    enabled: true
    mode: STRICT
  authorization:
    enabled: true
    
traffic:
  routing:
    enabled: true
  resilience:
    circuitBreaker: true
    faultInjection: true
    
gateways:
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    type: LoadBalancer
    autoscaling:
      enabled: true
      minReplicas: 2
      
observability:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    provider: jaeger
  metrics:
    enabled: true
    retention: "15d"
  logging:
    enabled: true
    
api:
  gateway:
    enabled: true
    provider: gloo  # or ambassador
    
certificates:
  issuer: cert-manager
  duration: "8760h"  # 1 year
```

### Breaking Changes
<!-- Would this feature introduce breaking changes? Please describe -->
No breaking changes as this is a new chart. The modular design allows for switching between mesh providers and components.

## Additional context
<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here -->
This chart would provide a production-ready service mesh solution that can be easily deployed and maintained, with support for both simple and complex networking scenarios.

## Benefits
<!-- Describe the benefits this feature would bring to users -->
1. Simplified mesh deployment and management
2. Zero-trust security by default
3. Advanced traffic management
4. Built-in observability
5. Multi-cluster support
6. API gateway integration
7. Production-ready defaults
