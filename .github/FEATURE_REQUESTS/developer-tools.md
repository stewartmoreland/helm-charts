## Target Chart
<!-- Specify which chart this feature request is for, or "new" for a new chart proposal -->
Chart: new - developer-tools

## Is your feature request related to a problem?
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->
Setting up a complete development environment in Kubernetes is time-consuming and complex. Teams need various tools for coding, debugging, testing, and collaboration, while maintaining consistency and security across environments.

## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen -->
A comprehensive developer tools chart that includes:
- DevSpace for development environments
- Telepresence for local development
- Code-Server (VS Code) for web-based IDE
- Harbor for container registry
- Nexus for artifact repository
- SonarQube for code quality
- Jenkins X or Tekton for CI/CD
- Development namespace management

## Describe alternatives you've considered
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered -->
1. Manual tool installation
2. Cloud-based development environments
3. Local development only
4. Commercial development platforms

## Implementation Details
<!-- If you can, explain how this feature might be implemented -->
1. Set up development namespace automation
2. Configure IDE and development tools
3. Implement CI/CD pipelines
4. Set up artifact management
5. Configure code quality tools
6. Implement access controls
7. Enable collaborative features
